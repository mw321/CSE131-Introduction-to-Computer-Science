 * There are many ways of supplying a Guess:  randomly, by user choice, etc.

 * of this interface are interchangeable.
 * 
 * For example, it is useful to drive this project with an automatic Guess supplier,
 * hence the implementations RandomGuessProvider and StaticGuessProvider,
 * but in a real game, you might want the user to formulate a Guess.
