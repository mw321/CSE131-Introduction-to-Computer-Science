/**
 * A Guess has-an array of integers.
 * 
 * Instead of representing a peg by a color, we will
 *   represent it by a small integer value,
 *   starting at 0.  This is the "model" for a peg ,and its
 *   color might be a "view" of a peg.
 *   
 * So in the standard game with 6 colors for pegs we have pegs
 * identified by the integers 0 through 5.
 *   
 *   
 * The array of a Guess specifies the pegs of a guess by
 *   their encoding number.
 *   
 * So the array
 * [ 4, 3, 5, 1 ]
 *  Has peg (of identity) 4 in the leftmost hole
 *      peg               3 in the second hole
 *      peg               5 in the third hole
 *      peg               1 in the rightmost hole
 *      
 * You do not need to validate the contents of the elements of the array.
 * This is a "friend" class for the project, in the sense that only trusted
 *    components create Guess instances.
 *
